# Elixir Phoenix Guide for Claude Code

**Version:** 1.2.0 | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

An essential development guide for Claude Code that ensures idiomatic Elixir and Phoenix LiveView code. This plugin includes enforced skills, hooks, and agent documentation that actively guide and validate your Elixir development workflow.

> **v1.2.0 Released!** Major restructuring: Plugin renamed to `elixir-phoenix-guide`, skills consolidated from 8 to 4, RULES sections added, and enforcement strengthened. **Existing users must uninstall and reinstall** (see below).

## What's Included

### Skills (4 essential files)
Consolidated domain expertise with enforced patterns:
- **elixir-essentials** - Core Elixir patterns: pattern matching, pipes, with statements, error handling
- **phoenix-liveview-essentials** - Complete LiveView guide: lifecycle, events, rendering phases, state management
- **ecto-essentials** - Database operations: schemas, changesets, queries, migrations, associations
- **phoenix-uploads** - File uploads and static file serving workflow

Each skill includes a RULES section with 7-8 non-negotiable patterns that must be followed.

**Note on auto_suggest metadata:** Skills include `auto_suggest: true` and `file_patterns` metadata for future Claude Code enhancements. These fields are not currently active in the Claude Code runtime but are included for forward compatibility.

### Hooks (10 shell commands in settings.json)
Active enforcement rules that catch anti-patterns in real-time:

**Blocking (exit 2 - prevents action):**
- **missing-impl** - Blocks callbacks without @impl true
- **hardcoded-paths** - Blocks hardcoded file paths
- **hardcoded-sizes** - Blocks hardcoded file size limits
- **static-paths-validator** - Blocks file references not in static_paths()
- **deprecated-components** - Blocks deprecated Phoenix components (.flash_group, form_for, live_redirect)
1
**Warnings (exit 1 - shows warning, allows action):**
- **nested-if-else** - Warns about nested if/else, suggests pattern matching
- **inefficient-enum** - Warns about multiple Enum operations
- **string-concatenation** - Warns about string concatenation in loops
- **auto-upload-warning** - Warns when auto_upload: true is detected

### Agent Documentation (4 files)
Detailed reference material for complex tasks:
- **project-structure.md** - Directory layout and context boundaries
- **liveview-checklist.md** - Step-by-step LiveView development checklist
- **ecto-conventions.md** - Comprehensive Ecto patterns and best practices
- **testing-guide.md** - Testing patterns for contexts, LiveViews, and schemas

### Project Template
- **CLAUDE.md.template** - Project-specific instructions template

## Installation

> **Note:** Official marketplace publication is in progress. Once available, installation will be even simpler through the official Claude Code marketplace.

### Installing for the First Time

In a Claude Code session, use the interactive plugin manager:

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace (first time only)
/plugin marketplace add j-morgan6/elixir-phoenix-guide

# Step 2: Open the interactive plugin manager
/plugin

# This opens an interactive menu where you can:
# - Select the elixir-phoenix-guide marketplace
# - Install the elixir-phoenix-guide plugin
# - Choose scope (user = all projects, project = current only)
# - Verify you have version 1.1.2 or higher
```

### Updating to Latest Version

If you already have the plugin installed:

```bash
# Open the interactive plugin manager
/plugin

# Select "Marketplaces" → "elixir-phoenix-guide" → "Update"
# Then update the plugin from the menu
# Verify version shows 1.1.2 or higher
```

**Latest Updates:**
- Fixed marketplace version detection issue
- New **skill-discovery** meta-skill for systematic skill selection
- All skills updated with mandatory "INVOKE BEFORE" language
- File pattern detection for automatic skill suggestions

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes and version history.

## Usage

Once installed, Claude Code will automatically:

1. **Load skills** based on code context - providing intelligent suggestions for Elixir patterns
2. **Enforce hooks** in real-time - catching anti-patterns as you write code
3. **Reference agent docs** when needed - accessing detailed information for complex tasks
4. **Follow CLAUDE.md** (if present) - respecting project-specific conventions

### Example Interactions

**Before (without optimization):**
```elixir
def process(user) do
  if user.status == :active do
    if user.role == :admin do
      :allowed
    else
      :denied
    end
  else
    :inactive
  end
end
```

**After (with hooks and skills):**
- Hook warns about nested if/else
- Skill suggests pattern matching
- Claude generates:

```elixir
def process(%{status: :active, role: :admin}), do: :allowed
def process(%{status: :active}), do: :denied
def process(_), do: :inactive
```

### Testing the Setup

1. Open a Phoenix/Elixir project in Claude Code
2. Ask Claude to create a LiveView
3. Observe:
   - Skills guide idiomatic implementation
   - Hooks catch anti-patterns (missing @impl, hardcoded values)
   - Agent docs provide detailed checklists

## What This Optimizes

### Code Quality
- **Blocks** callbacks without @impl true (prevents compilation)
- **Blocks** hardcoded file paths and sizes (prevents runtime issues)
- **Warns** about nested if/else (suggests pattern matching)
- **Warns** about inefficient Enum chains (suggests for comprehensions)
- **Warns** about string concatenation in loops (suggests IO lists)

### Developer Experience
- Proactive guidance on Elixir idioms
- Real-time feedback on code quality
- Detailed checklists for complex features
- Consistent conventions across projects
- Reduced iterations and corrections

### Learning
- Clear explanations of "why" not just "what"
- Links to relevant patterns and best practices
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Examples of idiomatic vs non-idiomatic code

## Why This Exists

This plugin was created to ensure Claude Code consistently produces idiomatic Elixir and Phoenix code by making best practices impossible to ignore, not just available. It combines enforced patterns, real-time validation, and comprehensive guidance for all Elixir development work.

## Project-Specific Setup

For project-specific instructions, you can create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root with:
- Your app name and description
- Project-specific contexts
- Custom commands and workflows
- Team conventions

This file will be automatically loaded by Claude Code when working in your project.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI installed
- Elixir 1.15+ projects
- Phoenix 1.7+ (for LiveView features)

## Customization

After installation via the plugin manager, all configuration files are installed to `~/.claude/`:
- Skills: `~/.claude/skills/`
- Hooks: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Agent docs: `~/.claude/agents/`

You can customize these files directly. Changes take effect after restarting Claude Code.

### Adding Custom Skills
Create new directories with `SKILL.md` files in `~/.claude/skills/`

### Modifying Existing Rules
Edit any skill or hook file - changes take effect on next Claude Code restart
