# Changelog

All notable changes to the Elixir Phoenix Guide plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Automated code quality detection system (v2.0.0)
- Additional skills and hooks (v2.1.0)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed planning.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-12

### Breaking Changes
- **Plugin renamed** from `elixir-optimization` to `elixir-phoenix-guide`
  - Better reflects purpose: essential guide for ALL Elixir work, not just optimization
  - Update marketplace references and installation commands
  - Reinstall required for existing users

### Changed
- **Skills consolidated from 8 to 4** for reduced friction:
  - `elixir-essentials` (merged elixir-patterns + error-handling)
  - `phoenix-liveview-essentials` (merged phoenix-liveview + liveview-lifecycle)
  - `ecto-essentials` (renamed from ecto-database)
  - `phoenix-uploads` (merged in phoenix-static-files content)
  - Removed skill-discovery meta-skill (no longer needed)

- **RULES sections added** to all skills:
  - 7-8 non-negotiable rules at the top of each skill
  - Rules visible in 10 seconds, reference examples below
  - Agents internalize rules, reference examples when needed

- **Skill descriptions shortened and strengthened**:
  - Changed from "INVOKE BEFORE" to "MANDATORY for ALL"
  - Removed feature lists that enable rationalization
  - Single-sentence descriptions using forceful language
  - Example: "MANDATORY for ALL Elixir code changes. Invoke before writing any .ex or .exs file."

- **CLAUDE.md template updated** with enforcement section:
  - Mandatory rules block added to template
  - Specifies exact skill invocation requirements per file type
  - Explicit "not optional" language
  - Projects adopting template get built-in enforcement

- **Reminder hook added**:
  - Non-blocking (exit 0) reminder on .ex/.exs/.heex writes
  - Prompts agent to verify skill invocation
  - Gentle nudge without preventing work

### Documentation
- **Metadata limitations documented**:
  - README now clarifies auto_suggest and file_patterns are forward-looking
  - Noted as pending Claude Code runtime support
  - False expectation claims removed from v1.1.0 changelog references

### Impact
- Reduced cognitive load: 4 skills vs 8 means less choice paralysis
- Improved adoption: MANDATORY language harder to rationalize away
- Better enforcement: CLAUDE.md template + hooks + reminders create multiple touchpoints
- Clearer purpose: "guide" name indicates this applies to ALL work, not just performance tuning

### Migration Notes
For existing users:
1. Uninstall `elixir-optimization` plugin
2. Install new `elixir-phoenix-guide` plugin from marketplace
3. Update project CLAUDE.md files if using template
4. Skill invocations use new names with same plugin prefix

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **skill-discovery meta-skill** - Systematic checklist for identifying applicable skills
  - File type detection for automatic skill suggestion
  - Task type detection for process skills
  - Priority-ordered skill invocation guide
  - Example workflows for common scenarios
  - Marked as priority 1 skill to invoke first

### Changed
- **All 7 existing skills updated** with mandatory "INVOKE BEFORE" language:
  - elixir-patterns: "INVOKE BEFORE writing any Elixir code"
  - phoenix-liveview: "INVOKE BEFORE implementing any LiveView feature"
  - ecto-database: "INVOKE BEFORE modifying any Ecto schema, query, or migration"
  - error-handling: "INVOKE BEFORE implementing error handling"
  - phoenix-uploads: "INVOKE BEFORE implementing file upload functionality"
  - phoenix-static-files: "INVOKE BEFORE serving uploaded files or static content"
  - liveview-lifecycle: "INVOKE BEFORE working with LiveView rendering phases"

- **File pattern metadata added** to all skills:
  - Skills now include file_patterns array for automatic detection
  - auto_suggest: true flag enables proactive skill suggestions
  - Pattern matching for .ex, .exs, .heex files and specific directories

### Impact
- Expected 50%+ increase in skill usage through forcing language
- Automatic skill suggestions when editing relevant files
- Systematic skill discovery prevents missing applicable guidance
- Better developer experience with proactive skill recommendations

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- **7 Skills** for Elixir and Phoenix development:
  - `elixir-patterns` - Pattern matching, pipes, with statements, naming conventions
